    //DBXref descriptions are rarely used and as of obof1.4 are discouraged.

    //Dbxref lists are used when a tag value must contain several dbxrefs. Dbxref lists take the following form:

    //The brackets may contain zero or more comma separated dbxref definitions. An example of a dbxref list can be seen in the GO def for "ribonuclease MRP complex":

    //def: "A ribonucleoprotein complex that contains an RNA molecule of the snoRNA family, and cleaves the rRNA precursor as part of rRNA transcript processing. It also has other roles: In S. cerevisiae it is involved in cell cycle-regulated degradation of daughter cell-specific mRNAs, while in mammalian cells it also enters the mitochondria and processes RNAs to create RNA primers for DNA replication."
